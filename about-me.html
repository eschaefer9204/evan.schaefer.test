        Written Bio: <div>My name is Evan. I'm of an undisclosed age and I live in Toronto.
        I love art and design and find myself reading about them often. So much so in fact that
        I have 2 giant stacks of books I've recently purchased which discuss different histories and aspects
        of art and design. I'm currently reading through Don Norman's <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/books/design-everyday-things-revised/"><em>The Design of Everyday Things.</em></a>
    </div>

    <p>
        Goals: 
        <div>My ultimate goal is to expand upon my fashion design background and
        specialize in both digital and printed textile design. I want to design fabrics, not just for garments, but for
        everything; from the textiles used to decorate seats on buses to the higher-end use textiles
        sought after by industrial and product designers.
